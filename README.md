## JATE (Just Another Text Editor)
# JATE is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that works both online and offline. The application allows users to take and save notes, and it leverages IndexedDB for storing content on the client side. Itâ€™s built using Webpack for bundling the front-end, with Express.js running the back-end server. This app also implements service workers for offline functionality.

## Features
- Offline Functionality: The app works without an internet connection by using IndexedDB and service workers.
- Progressive Web App (PWA): The app can be installed on mobile and desktop devices.
- Text Editing: Users can create, edit, and save notes.
- Service Worker: Implements a service worker for caching assets and enabling offline usage.
- Automatic Saving: Text is automatically saved while the user is editing.
